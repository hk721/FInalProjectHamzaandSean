# In our final project, we used a data visulaztion libray called Seaborn along with Pandas, which is a libray used for data manipulating and organzing. In order to obtain these libaries they can be downloaded from https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/ and https://pandas.pydata.org/. After these are installed, as we did in our code , in the 1st line code we imported the libraies as the following: " import pandas as pd" and " import Seaborn". Doing this allows for Python to combine to operations. When trying to run the program you will see the visual aids that have been added in order to demonstrate the manipulation of the raw data.
